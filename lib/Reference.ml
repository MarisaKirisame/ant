(* The Reference
 * To track whether a fragment is fetched or unfetched,
 *   and extend the seq finger tree to include a Reference Type.
 * For a value with depth x+1, the Reference is an index into the C/E/S/K of the machine at depth x.
 * A key invariant is that a machine at depth x only contain values with depth x or with depth x+1,
 *   and a key collary is that machine at depth x is only able to fetch value at depth x-1:
 *   The machine only contain reference with depth x or x+1, and the latter is already fetched, so cannot be fetched again.
